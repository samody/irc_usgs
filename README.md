# irc_usgs
Written by samody.

This is a rough working irc bot used to poll USGS site data and return the output.

Anyone is free to use this bot. 

At the time of writing it is currently in use by #TropicalWeather


Future:
This bot doesn't have any furture plans. Anything that would come after this will be a new repo.
However if anyone is interested in extending this bot feel free to put in a pull request.
